# STRK-Schedule 🏪🧬

**A Web3-powered decentralized healthcare platform for diabetes management, built with React and Starknet.**

## 🚀 Overview

**STRK-Schedule** is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to transform how chronic conditions like diabetes are managed—especially within public healthcare systems. By integrating modern Web3 tools such as NFTs, DAOs, and Starknet's Layer 2 scaling, STRK-Schedule empowers patients, doctors, and governments to shift from reactive to proactive healthcare.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting millions. Traditional healthcare systems often lack the continuous, personalized care necessary for long-term disease management. In public healthcare, outdated infrastructure, fragmented data, and lack of incentives result in inefficiencies, higher costs, and poor health outcomes.
